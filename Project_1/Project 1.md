##### Bode Plot of $V_o$
The transfer function has 4 independent capacitors, so it will have 4 poles. 

### Finding Poles
Midband peak value lies around -7.235 dB. 
For a 3% dip we will find the frequency when magnitude is -7.545 dB. 
w = 1.15  kHz, 1.62MHz

The gradient's magnitude is clearly 40 dB/decade. Since there are no inductors/op amps it has to be two simple poles on each side. The phase difference is so consistent (2 90 degree poles so close together it looks like a -180 phase shift.)
